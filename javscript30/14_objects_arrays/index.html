    // let age = 100; 
    // let age2 = age; 
    // console.log(age, age2); 
    // age = 200; 
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name2 = name; 
    // console.log(name, name2); 
    // name = 'wesley'; 
    // console.log(name, name2); 

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const team = players; 

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    console.log(players, team); 

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; 

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // When you update an array it will reference back!

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // If you pass slice nothing, it takes copy of actual array! 
    const team2 = players.slice(); 

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); 

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; 
    team[4] = 'heee hawwwww'; 
    console.log(team4); 

    const team5 = Array.from(players); 
 
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person; 
    // captain.number = 99; 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Take a blank object, overwrite properties from object, use third argument to fold in our new ones 
    const cap3 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12}); 
    console.log(cap2); 

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes', 
      age: 100, 
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos', 
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear(); 
    console.log(wes); 

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); 

    // JSON.stringify can be passed an object, which returns to a string which is no longer an object 
    // Then immediately JSON.parse to return to an object 
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); 

    // Can use dot notation in console to assign properties 
    // Object.assign only does one level deep; if you need to use a clone, use clone.deep
