# How JavaScript works
_Notes from the book by Douglas Crockford_.

## 1: How names work 
- "We have learned the very hard way that programming should strive to be literate and self-explanatory. Programming is not mathematics. It is a different sort of art." 
- Start and end variable names with letters. _underbars and $dollars have special meanings. 
- In multiword variables, underbar in JS will make transitioning languages easier, e.g. lots_of_words. 
- Only constructor functions start with uppercase in JavaScript. 
- Reserved words: can't be used for anything other than what already used for: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp 
- So don't use them for variable names! 
- Holdovers from 50's with limited memory: no spaces in variable names; reserved words -- all to save memory 

## 2 How numbers work 
- Single number type: `number`
