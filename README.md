# JavaScript study 

A repo to store all the things I'm learning as I focus on JavaScript this month, including: 
- Notes from "How JavaScript works" 
- Code challenges I complete during Udemy's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass.
- Anything I think is worth saving from Wes Bos' JavaScript 30.
